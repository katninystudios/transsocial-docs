## Activities API
!!! warning
    TransSocial Activities, at this current point in time, is more concept than being a real thing. These docs likely will not work correctly, and may be very quickly outdated *if* it does work. If we open the Activities API outside of just our own usage, we'll make sure to create stable documentation. However, in this current point in time, we're still in the **planning stage** of the Activities API.
